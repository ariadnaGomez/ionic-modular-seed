The `app/scss/variables/` directory
==========================================

Here is where the site settings of our Sass development are defined.

- We can personalize general project variables like media queries, layout, grids...
- We can have different settings to allow fast changes in the whole site by only changing this site-settings.scss.
- Here are defined things like the colors or fonts variables used in the other Sass files.
